            <p>The data visualization is an interactive scatterplot exploring the relationship between food insecurity and mental health.
                The data uses information from self reports. The plot also uses the variables sex, territory/province, and indigenous group.
                
                Based off the visualization, the higher number of households experiencing food insecurity had higher percentages of self reports for fair or poor mental health among the majority of the populations. 
                The both sexes plot indicates a positive correlation between mental health and food insecurity.
                Since the Inuit population has one point, it is difficult to conclude a relationship between these variables for that particular group. 
                The males generally had lower percentages for fair or poor mental health and number of households with food insecurity in comparison to females.
